<p>pool of salt water connected to the ocean</p>
<h3>Types of sea</h3>
<lo>
    <li>Marginal sea - a sea that is not connected to the ocean but to another, larger sea and serves as its "arm", such as the Adriatic Sea. In this sea the currents are dictated by winds.</li>
    <li>Intercontinental sea - a sea surrounded by land on all sides, like the Mediterranean Sea. In this sea the currents in it are mainly dictated by changes in salinity levels and temperature and not by the winds.</li>
    <li>Inland sea - a sea that is actually a "lake" or "semi-lake", but contains salt water, like the Caspian Sea. This sea does not meet the Haggadah of a real sea, unless the opening is close enough to an ocean or another sea.</li>
    <li>On loan, a number of lakes or "seas", which are not connected to the sea but are closed on land, can be salty or even sweet and are still called "sea" in common parlance (such as the Caspian Sea, the Dead Sea and even the Sea of ​​Galilee). The same is true for parts of those lakes (eg bays, straits or lagoons).</li>
